Testing solution generation with integrated validation:

Tests:
    1. Testing if it is better to have the maxElm a primitive that is returned or reference to an Object
        a. Test description: I'm using 10 consecutive getSol() (with size = 5) calls and I measure the average time spent for each case.
        b. Results:
            i. Test 1 for maxElm as primitive and returning the value - 662ms on Average over 10 calls.
            ii. Test 2 for maxElm as primitive and returning the value - 671ms on Average over 10 calls.
            iii. Test 3 for maxElm as primitive and returning the value - 607ms on Average over 10 calls.
            iv. Test 4 for maxElm as primitive and returning the value - 647ms on Average over 10 calls.
            v. Test 5 for maxElm as primitive and returning the value - 657ms on Average over 10 calls.
            vi. Test 6 for maxElm as Object - 601ms on Average over 10 calls.
            vii. Test 7 for maxElm as Object - 599ms on Average over 10 calls.
            viii. Test 8 for maxElm as Object - 599ms on Average over 10 calls.
            ix. Test 9 for maxElm as Object - 601ms on Average over 10 calls.
            x. Test 10 for maxElm as Object - 606ms on Average over 10 calls.
        c. Analysis: Having maxElm as an int and returning it results in an average call duration of 648.8ms over 50 calls, 
        whereas having it as an Object results in an average call duration of 601.2ms.
        d. Conclusion: Having it as an int is about 8% slower, therefore having it as an Object is prefered.
    2. Testing if it is better two have the recursion aggregates as global variables.
        a. Test description: I'm using the same 10 consecutive getSol() calls and I measure the average time spent for each case.
        b. Results:
            i. Test 1 with passing local variables: 650ms, 664ms, 642ms, 670ms, 647ms (654.6 average)
            ii. Test 2 with global variables: 679ms, 700ms, 713ms, 657ms, 683ms (686.4 average)
        Conclusion: It might be better to have local variables, but it might be due to the stress in the system at different times.
